/**
 @brief Measure the motor's BEMF
 
 
 
 This class is based on the VirtualADC class which provides  hardware access to the
 analogue to digital converter.
 
 BEMF is measured across motor using a differential op. amp.  The op. amp. output is centered on Arduino 5V/2
 or 3.3V/2 depending on the Arduino board used.
 
 8 NiMH cells give a nominal 9.6V
 
 The Arduino supply is used as reference and nominal range at Arduino Vcc/2 +/- 9.6 * op. amp. gain
 Zero bemf is read as c. 512.
 
 Op. amp. output is connected to Arduino Nano 33 BLE pin A3 .
 
 The BEMF readings are filtered
 -  using a statistical median digital filter and,
 - a simple Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) low pass digital filter
